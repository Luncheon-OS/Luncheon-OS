Thanks for choosing Luncheon OS!

This install medium may be used in three ways:
1. To actually install the OS: `lunchtime`
2. To install Arch for some reason: `archinstall` or install traditionally
3. Repair an existing Linux OS

If you're coming from Windows, congratulations! The installer is straight-forward and simple, so don't worry.
